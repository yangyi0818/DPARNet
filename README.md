# DPARNet
Dual-Path Attention and Recurrent Network for speech separation

DPARNet, which is an improvement of DPTFSNet [1], is composed of encoder, separation network and decoder. To alleviate the computation burden, sub-band processing approach is leveraged in the encoder. Dual-path attention mechanism and recurrent network structure are introduced in the separation network to model the speech signals in each sub-band, which facilitate extraction of deep feature information and rich spectrum details.
